            <p>Hello, my name is Braxton LaFleur. I grew up and live in Syracuse, Utah. I have
                served a
                mission for my church in Virginia, which allowed me to visit many American Civil War
                history sites. I'm currently going through schooling to become a Seminary and
                Institute
                teacher. However, failing that, I have become very interested in the field of coding
                and
                found great satisfaction in learning how to code.</p>

            <p>Utah is a state in the midwest of America. Home to a rugged desert beauty, there are
                many
                amazing places to visit. As the picture above shows, there are many beautiful
                natural
                arch formations in the south east of the state.</p>
