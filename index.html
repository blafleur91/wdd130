        <p>Hello, my name is Braxton LaFleur. I grew up and live in Syracuse, Utah. I have served a
            mission for my church in Virginia, which allowed me to visit many American Civil War
            history sites. I'm currently going through schooling to become a Seminary and Institute
            teacher. However, failing that, I have become very interested in the field of coding and
            found great satisfaction in learning how to code.</p>
